            I am a professional Software Engineer, who has served the industry
            for more than two and half years. I am a Fullstack
            engineer(FE-heavy) with great experience in web technologies.
            Advanced ReactJs with mid-level Nextjs is my expertise. Magnificent
            experience with server-side javascript(Nodejs), API(Rest, GraphQl),
            relational database(MySQL, PostgreSQL), and non-relational
            database(MongoDB) in addition to being an Addis Ababa Science and
            technology university graduate with BSc in software engineering. I
            love working on tech projects and get challenged with complex ideas
            to bring to the world. Itâ€™s been a while since I started this
            journey. My energy and passion-driven approach might be a huge asset
            to your project or company. Letâ€™s connect, letâ€™s work together. By
            the way, Arsenal is bestðŸ˜‰.
